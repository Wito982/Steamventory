# Steamventory

## Overview

Steamventory is a free, ad-free, and open-source browser extension that helps you manage your family group library on Steam by indicating in your wishlist the games that are already being shared by those users. This way, you can prioritize other purchases and make informed decisions about your game acquisitions.

## Features

- **Automatic Visualization of Family Library Games**: Easily identify which games are already available to avoid duplicate purchases.
- **Multiple Account Compatibility**: Add Steam IDs or usernames of the members of your family group.
- **Visual Indicator**: Shows a bookmark icon next to the games already shared in the wishlist.

## How It Works

1. Open Steamventory in your wishlist.
2. Enter the IDs or usernames from the Steam community URL to see the names of their games.

3. The extension will automatically mark the games that are already in the family library with a bookmark icon and the username of the person who has it.
